# ED Pneumonia Risk Stratification CDS Design

This repository documents the design of a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tool aimed at improving early identification of Emergency Department (ED) patients at risk for severe pneumonia.

## Project Objective

To create a CDS system that integrates into ED triage workflows, helping clinicians stratify pneumonia risk and act earlier on high-risk cases. The tool is designed to reduce delays in care, improve patient outcomes, and support better resource allocation.

## Key Components

- **Risk Scoring Algorithm**: Based on patient vitals, symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical criteria
- **Workflow Mapping**: Designed for integration into ED triage modules and physician intake processes
- **BPA Alert Mockups**: Includes logic, acknowledgment flows, and recommended actions based on risk levels
- **Decision Tree Logic**: Maps risk inputs to triage actions (Low, Moderate, High Risk)
- **Pseudocode**: Sample logic illustrating EHR integration
- **Evaluation Plan**: Includes process metrics, outcome metrics, and safety/balancing metrics

## Deliverables

- Full design document with logic, alert structure, UI recommendations, and implementation strategy

## Status

Complete. This project was developed as part of a clinical informatics design initiative simulating real-world CDS tool implementation.
